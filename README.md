  <h5> Why Are These Modules Important to my Learning?</h5>
  <p> These modules have helped me learn how to even code this website! Although sometimes the modules can get a little boring 
      they do really help you expand your knowledge in the course. For me personally, I find that Khan Academy is a great
      tool for all learners because having the mini challenges along the way makes it easier to complete the final project
      at the end of the module. Alhough personally I prefer reading new information instead of watching a video, learning
      from Khan Academy was not hard and it was very easy to learn from it. If I continue to work on my skills in computer
      programming I am confident that I could refer myself back to these modules in order to refresh my memory. 
  
  <h3> Coding Challenge </h3>
  <p> I completed the coding challenge by Dan, #116, about Lissajous tables. <br>
      This taught me many new things I hadn't known how to use while coding before. It was very cool to learn
      how to program in other software I hadn't used (processing) since in my last computer science class we used
      Adobe and CS. I would recommend this challenge to other computer science students as it was a great way to 
      get engaged and have some  fun with coding as well.<br>
