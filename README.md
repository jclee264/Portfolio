  <h3> Coding Challenge </h3>
  <p> I completed the coding challenge by Dan, #116, about Lissajous tables. <br>
      This taught me many new things I hadn't known how to use while coding before. It was very cool to learn
      how to program in other software I hadn't used (processing) since in my last computer science class we used
      Adobe and CS. I would recommend this challenge to other computer science students as it was a great way to 
      get engaged and have some  fun with coding as well.<br>
